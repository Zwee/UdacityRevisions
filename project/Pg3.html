        <p>&lt;img&gt; tag is used to insert an image. It contains only attributes, and does NOT have a closing tag.

        <h3><span class="highlighter">Why you should get in the habit of using alt text:</span></h3>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Lets you know something is preventing your picture from rendering on the page
            </li>
            <li>Alt text can describe what's there/what was supposed to be there
            </li>
            <li>Helpful for the visually impaired

        <h3><span class="bling">Whitespace is the the all parts of the code where there is no code.</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Whitespace is all the blank screen around the words. With other applications, like typing up a term paper in MS Word, whitespace can make a big difference. It can break up paragraphs, force text to display on an additional page, or make the text uncomfortable to read. But in HTML, <span class="highlighter">whitespace doesn't matter.(*)</span>
        </p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tleSnj4OD0g"></iframe>
        <p>It doesn't matter how many times you hit your 'space' or 'enter' keys: unless you tell the computer where the breaks are, it will show everything in one looooooooong line.
        </p>
        <p>'Break' or &lt;br&gt; is a void tag (and an inline tag) that provides line breaks. It just says 'the line ends here'. &#40;Or, to quote Capt. Jean-Luc Picard: &quot;The line must be drawn here! This far, no further!&quot;&#41;
        <span class="highlighter">(*)Unless we're talking about class selectors, but more on that later...</span>
