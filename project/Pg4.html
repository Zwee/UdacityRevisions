        </h2>
            Make web pages with compled structures possible.
            CSS is used to adjust different behaviours, to change how they display.
        <h3 class="bling">Span and Div
        </h3>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Both are regular elements & can have content
            </li>
            <li>Their sole purpose it to contain things
            </li>
            <li>Span is an INLINE container element
            </li>
            <li>Div creates a 'BOX' container element

          <p>&lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are very similar, but &lt;span&gt; doesn't do any formatting itself. &lt;div&gt; can affect things because it defines logical breaks or divisions within the page(s). Meanwhile, the &lt;span&gt; tag just tells the browser to apply style rules to whatever's within the &lt;span&gt;.
          </p>
          <h4 class="bling"> Div:
          </h4>
          &lt;div&gt; divides the content on screen using a line break above the &lt;div&gt; tag and another below the &lt;/div&gt; tag.
          <p>The &lt;div&gt; tag defines logical divisions in your Web page. It's like a &lt;p&gt; tag, but it divides up the page(s) into larger sections than the &lt;p&gt; tag would. It also gives you the power to define big chunks of HTML.
          </p>
          <p>&lt;div&gt; will help you label certain sections of your page(s) so you can make changes to them en masse with CSS. It's also helpful to remember that the &lt;div&gt; tag will break paragraphs, as it gets read as a &lt;p&gt; end/beginning, so you can have &lt;p&gt; within a &lt;div&gt;, you can't have a &lt;div&gt; within a &lt;p&gt;.
          </p>
          <span class="bling">The main attributes of the &lt;div&gt; tag are:</span>
          1) <span class="highlighter">style</span>    2) <span class="highlighter">class</span>    3) <span class="highlighter">id</span>

          <h2 class="bling"> Span:
          </h2>
          <p>&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; items are displayed without line breaks.
          &lt;div&gt; defines logical divisions in your Web page. It's like a &lt;p&gt; tag, but it divides up the page(s) into larger sections than the &lt;p&gt; tag would. It also gives you the power to define big chunks of HTML.

          <p>
          The &lt;span&gt; has a lot in common with the &lt;div&gt; tag. It changes the style of the text that is contained within, however it won't change any of the content text until you first assign style attributes.
        </p>
        <p>&lt;span&gt; is an in-line element and most often used to smaller chunks of in-line HTML. &lt;div&gt; is a block element (or 'block-line', which is basically the same as having a &lt;br&gt; before and after it) and used to group up larger bits of code.
